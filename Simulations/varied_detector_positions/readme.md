Hi Andres,

 

Main purpose design changing: Current cart is a separate unit, new will be fixed behind the car.

For that, to reduce the dimensions and weight, neutron tube supposed to be adjust vertical. If not tube radius is 5 cm, it will be increased till 15 cm. So, need to optimize height system above the ground, and shielding size.

I attach program with design of the current MINS system. The program calculated 2 spectra, INS and TNC. You can acquire only one spectrum, it will be much faster, and you can run 1e9 or 1e10 events.

The statistics should be good enough to compare C peak area as an optimization factor.

I’m sending your some start dimensions. The dimensions of the detectors, wheels, shielding thickness and material remain the same.

One more. Now neutron target is above bottom of shielding and detectors. Put in on the same level (the footprint will be increased in this case).

 

First. Set all dimensions as it is, it will be base spectrum.

Then:

Change height  about 25 – 50 cm range. Plot dependency C peak area with Height. And choose the optimal (max peak area)
At optimal H, change distances b/w target and shielding. Will look, what happened. Don’t forgot take background spectrum at each simulation. Choose optimal distance.
Let’s take some simulations again vs height (around optimal H) at optimal distance
After that, will move detectors closer to the shielding, and will see what happened.
 

Lets keep soil as it is (C content as in our calibration pit, you can increase C content for better statistics, but sizes two time more, pretend like infinite soil).

 

My geometry description is no good, I use surfaces instead of boxes, if you change it for easier reading, will be good, but if not – ok.

 

Please, send me your program just for double check.

 

Sure, let me know if you will have any questions.

 

Thank you,

Galina
